# Complianz-Plugin-WP-Contact-form-7-integration-with-WP-Consent-API.-
I have got this message from Complianz Plugin : Due to the continuous changes in Contact Form 7 we are abandoning the integration with CF7 as of CF7 5.4. We have concluded that the only possible solution is for Contact Form 7 to integrate with the WP Consent API


Hi I am not a developer, and just moved to self-hosting from WP.com : need some help :-) 
They have suggested me Complianz for Cookies policy and started configuration on WP website. All fine except this integration with WP Contact form 7 5.4. 
1. do you have any update for this integration?
2. what should I do now? change plugin for cookies banner (I have my policy done, I just need to put a banner on the website)
   Thank you for all support. Antonella :-*
